Accurate stratification of centrifuged blood components-plasma, buffy coat, and erythrocyte layers-is critical for automated clinical laboratory workflows and quality assessment. Conventional methods relying on single-modality imaging or manual inspection fail to reliably localize the optically thin buffy coat layer while maintaining diagnostic precision and throughput. To address these challenges, this paper proposes DIUA-YOLO, a dual-illumination detection framework integrating white-light and blue-light imaging through a novel cross-modal attention mechanism. The framework employs independent dual-backbone networks to extract modality-specific features, followed by unidirectional token-based attention that enables blue-light features to query white-light context within localized spatial neighborhoods. This design fundamentally addresses spatial misalignment between modalities through implicit local feature correspondence while reducing computational complexity by approximately 91\% compared to global attention. Comprehensive evaluation on a dual-illumination dataset demonstrates that DIUA-YOLO achieves 98.80\% overall detection success rate under stringent clinical criteria requiring exact detection of all three layers without false positives or negatives. The framework attains 96.39\% buffy coat detection rate with sub-5-pixel boundary localization accuracy, representing transformative improvement over single-modality baselines. Statistical analysis confirms all architectural improvements are highly significant (p$<$0.001). The integrated automated platform processes complete tubes in 8 seconds, delivering 3.75$\times$ speedup over manual workflows. This work contributes methodological insights into multi-modal fusion for medical imaging and demonstrates strong potential for extension to other dual-modality diagnostic applications.
