Interpretation for Paper:
=========================

All key architectural decisions are statistically validated:

1. Dual-backbone is essential (highly significant improvement over single-backbone)

2. Cross-modal attention provides the best fusion mechanism (significant improvements
   over both simpler alternatives)

3. Transfer learning consistently helps across all architectures (all improvements
   statistically significant)

4. The effect size decreases but remains significant as baseline performance increases
   (from +30.73% for dual-backbone to +3.70% for final pretrain step)

5. The final model (Exp 7: 98.80%) significantly outperforms all alternatives
   (all p<0.01), validating the complete design choices.


Notes:
------
- All p-values are two-tailed
- Z-statistics are negative because we're testing improvement (p2 > p1)
- The smallest effect size (CrossAttn pretrain: +3.70%) still achieves p<0.01
- No multiple comparison correction was applied (each comparison tests a specific
  hypothesis about architectural design)
